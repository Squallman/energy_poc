## Objective: 
Let's say we want to find areas where significant groundwater occurrences (from **ergw1000_gwerg__v11_poly**) overlap with specific geological formations (from **ergw1000_gwerg_gestein_v1_poly**), such as limestone, dolomite, or gypsum (karst aquifer). This could help identify regions where significant groundwater is available in specific geological settings.
## Steps to Perform the Query:
1. **Load the Datasets into PostGIS**:
   - First, you would load the shapefiles into your PostGIS-enabled database. This can be done using tools like shp2pgsql or through a GIS software that supports PostGIS.
2. **Prepare the SQL Query**:
   - Assuming the tables are named after the shapefiles, the SQL query might look like this:
```sql
SELECT
    gw.id as gw_id,
    gs.id as gs_id,
    gw.bedeutung as groundwater_significance,
    gs.gestein as geological_formation,
    ST_Intersection(gw.geom, gs.geom) as overlap_area
FROM
    ergw1000_gwerg__v11_poly gw
JOIN
    ergw1000_gwerg_gestein_v1_poly gs
ON
    ST_Intersects(gw.geom, gs.geom)
WHERE
    gw.bedeutung = 'Bedeutende Grundwasservorkommen'
    AND gs.gestein = 'Kalkstein, Dolomit, Gips (Karstwasserleiter)'
```

1. Execute the Query:
   - Run this query in your PostgreSQL command line or through a database management tool that supports PostGIS.
2. Analyze the Results:
   - The query will return a set of overlapping areas where significant groundwater occurrences intersect with karst aquifer geological formations.
   - You can further analyze these results or visualize them using GIS software.

## Notes:
 - Replace gw.id and gs.id with the actual ID columns from your datasets.
 - The ST_Intersection function is used to get the geometric intersection of the overlapping areas.
 - The ST_Intersects function checks if two geometries intersect.
 - Adjust the WHERE clause based on the actual values in your datasets.
